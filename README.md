### Installation needed for running application


a) Install MySQL and setup using these commands, make sure the password you select is easy to remember
```
        $ sudo apt install mysql-server 
        $ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
                    or               
```
        $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

for my case, I found the second one easy as while installation I get an interface in terminal asking for a password and could diminish some step  for secure_installation which I feel a very annoying step
Note: After this setup, you should be able to run MySQL using this command, if not then try some of these issue links 
```
        $ mysql -u root -p
```

(In case you get the wrong password, do `sudo su`, then `mysql` create a new user with password and use that)  
          If you face error 1698`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281594/error-1698-28000-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost`      
          if you face error 1045`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21944936/error-1045-28000-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost-using-password-y`  

b) Installing RubyOnRails using rvm (ruby version manager)
   First, install curl and gnupg
```
        $ sudo apt install curl
        $ sudo apt install gnupg2
``` 

   Now, run these commands to install rvm
```
        curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg2 --import -  
        \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

**Important**: For RVM to work properly, you have to check the 'Run command as login shell' checkbox on the Title and Command tab of the terminal's Edit ▸ Profile Preferences menu dialog, in case the menu is missing right-click the terminal app and navigate Profiles ▸ Profile 

Now, we will be using rails 5.2.2 with ruby 2.6.1
```
        $ rvm install 2.6.1
        $ rvm use 2.6.1 --default
        $ gem install bundler
        $ gem install rails -v 5.2.2
```

Install mysql gem and the libmysql-dev library
```
        $ sudo apt install libmysqld-dev
        $ gem install mysql2
```

Note: For some of the js gems
```
        $ sudo apt install nodejs
```
